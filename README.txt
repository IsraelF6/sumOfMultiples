==================
 Sum of Multiples
==================

Made By: Israel Felhandler

This is a simple function that takes an integer, x,  as input and returns the sum of all the natural numbers less than x that
are multiples of 3 or 5. There is also a small driver function with some unit tests.

EX:
if x=10
multiples of 3 and 5 = 3, 5, 6, 9
sum of multiples = 23
